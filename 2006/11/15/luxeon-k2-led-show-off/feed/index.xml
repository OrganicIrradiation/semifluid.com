					<description><![CDATA[Hey,

i am in the process of building a super small portable projector. ive been looking into high power led&#039;s as a light source, but ive been coming short on the numbers. according to wikipedia, a 100W incandescent pumps out 1700 lumen. most of the luxeons can do a bit less than 200 lumen, so would i need to band together a couple (like 10), and if so what do you recommend?.

most of my calculations were based on area that i was hoping to project on (3 foot square screen). assuming that 70 percent of the light passes through the lcd as light, i was aiming at 1000 lumens for pre-lcd power. is this way off base?

your site&#039;s awesome and ridiculously informative, keep up the great work

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, those are amazing! I&#039;m totally jazzed about these Blue XR&#039;s and XR-E&#039;s. I&#039;m working on getting some, I&#039;ve found some optics and drivers for them. Where are you at in your projects? Do you have any of these XLamp LED&#039;s?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you want to know about High Power LEDs, take a look at www.candlepowerforums.com and be ready to be poorer :)

Also take a look at the new Cree XRE LEDs they double the K2 in efficiency (www.xlamp.com)
