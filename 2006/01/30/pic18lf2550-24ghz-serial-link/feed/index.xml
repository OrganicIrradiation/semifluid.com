					<description><![CDATA[Hi ! I am interested in your project. I compiled the asm code with MPLAB but unfortunately the built failed. There are several errors mainly about the configuration. Could you help me please? By the way I want to transmit and receive by rf from one pic to another. I mention this in case you have a program to do this. Thanks in advance, Mariana.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d like to share my experience after using this TRW-24G RF transceiver module.
It is very easy to get the hand-on and easy to integrate into wireless application.  I am the designer myself and I have used this module in various wireless application. I also found that there is a Taiwanese based company who&#039;s the true manufacturer of this transceiver module.  That is Wenshing (http://www.wenshing.com.tw/Products/RF_Module/Transceiver_Module/TRW-24G_2.4GHz_RF_Tranceiver_Module/)

You guys may have the same experience as I have while use it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hello , this project is just what im looking for!  im building an ultra-sonic self maintaining mobile radar scanner  for my BS project.. big name huh?! i tried usb communication but im stuck with a short range! so i need it wireless, and preferably i want to use ur project to make my last 25% part of my project.  Can you help me and send me the source codes to my email  ahmad_kaderi@hotmail.com ..cause HEX are useless if i want to change the program. And i will add your name in my BS report to maintain all rights. thank you in advance]]></description>
