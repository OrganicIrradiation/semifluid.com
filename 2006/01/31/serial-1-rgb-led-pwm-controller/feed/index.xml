					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m having a bit of difficulty with the code to this, every time I send a serial command the change is not smooth and the led&#039;s flicker on and off (I have a VB app that is trying to do smooth fades up and down)...do you have any ideas what I can do?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi!
What would the code an the schematic look like for RGB LEDs that have an common anode?

Thank you
Rupert]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Steve,
Sorry I&#039;m late, but codes does not work. Can you add button &quot;store&quot; to vb code,
and data will be stored to eeprom only when this button will be pressed?
Maybe this is easier way.
Thank you!

					<description><![CDATA[#4 (Tomy) - I&#039;ve emailed you the recompiled C files and corresponding hex files for a modification that saves the PWM to the EEPROM when they change.  Please let me know if they work!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you!
Because I can&#039;t to modify code myself, can you do it for me?I like 8 bit version.I&#039;m beginner so is too difficult for me to start with jal, because I still learn in mplab.
Sorry , my English is bad...

					<description><![CDATA[#1 &amp; #2 (tomy) - Unfortunately I don&#039;t have the assembly for this project.  However the JAL language is very similar to PASCAL and I&#039;d be more than happy to step you through the code to explain what it does.  Also, yes, it would be quite easy to store the data for the next power on.  All that you would have to do is store the values in EEPROM every time they change.]]></description>
