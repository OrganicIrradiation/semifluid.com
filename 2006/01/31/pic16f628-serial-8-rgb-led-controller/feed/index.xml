					<description><![CDATA[Cool Project...
But it doesnt compile with actual JAL V2.4n compiler and actual Jallib. 
So I will use your Code for learning purposes and try to rewrite it for the new Jallibs.
I used a PIC 18f2550 and USB instead of  RS232. Since my version doesnt run smoothly I now changed to use a Pic18f14k50 and an TLC5940 PWM Chip. It doesnt work well, yet, but when it is working well I will tell you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I must correct my last post. The problem is not with the RS232 interface. This is working ok. The problem is that I didn&#039;t connect the RGB LEDs which are made by Kingbright correctly. There are 6 connections and not 4. Sorry for the misleading post.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Steve,

Just put together your project. Nothing happens. No LEDs light up. It could be many things but I think the RS232 connection to my very old is not working If I read the EPROM directly, it is full of FFs.  Do you have somewhere a test program that just eluminates the LEDs with a default value. Many thanks in advance]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Steve, great job, thank you very much for share it...!
I¬¥m almost a beginner in electronics and I¬¥ve built the circuit successfully and It looks awesome...!
So far my programming knowledge allow me to build 16f628 based sequencers (up to 15 channels as I don¬¥t know much of multiplexing).
I¬¥d like to add other effects, like blinking three times red, three times green, three times blue, and others sequences. Is it possible to add three more led in paralell to make 4 x 8 channels? Can you help me with this...?
Thx in advance
