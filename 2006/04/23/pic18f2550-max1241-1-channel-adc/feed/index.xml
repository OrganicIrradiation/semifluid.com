					<description><![CDATA[hi , first would like to thank u for such a great set of tutorials/blog all ur projects are ineresting and informitive and set out very well this is a fab web site. i am intreaged though as the setion &quot;RS232 Level Converter&quot; says
&quot;The micro controller USART pins need to be connected to a RS-232 Level Converter to connect to a PC for firmware updates using the Tiny PIC Bootloader. Otherwise, after initial programming they can be left disconnected.&quot;
that rather suggests that no programming board is needed at all apat from a max232/max233 is this true for brand new chips or just all chips which already have boat loaders/firmware?? and whitch programming board do u prefer and do u use the tiny boat loader to program the pic all ways??
thank u very much for the blog and ur answer
will]]></description>
