					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing your project but couldn&#039;t help to spot a few problems:
Code:
    if (theCRC = in_data[7]) {
Classic &#039;=&#039; instead of &#039;==&#039;.
Now the test for a valid CRC will always succeed, except for a CRC value zero, then the program won&#039;t do what you expect.

Consequent use of &#039;&#038;&#039; instead of &#039;&#038;&#038;&#039;. The code works but doesn&#039;t show its intention.

Inside the serial interrupt routine it is not required to disable the Global interrupt as the hardware is doing this automatically. A few lines lower however, enabling the Global interrupt again is a bug. Normally the hardware handles this too. If another interrupt is waiting to be served then it would fire immediately, not allowing the current interrupt to restore its saved context with undefined behaviour as a result]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi everyone,

I&#039;m trying to display the waveform in PC using PIC18F2550 via USB.I&#039;m not good for write program on oshon software(basic or assembly)please help me if u know how to write the program circuit connection or else suggest some models.


Thanks

					<description><![CDATA[hi everybody!
i&#039;m trying to sending a data from PIC and get and display it from PC using VB6(such as numeric value). But i could not success. I could not find correct Schematic and vb program. I have some knowledge about VB6 but i have little knowledge about PIC.
I want to send a numeric value from PIC and get and display it on PC, or send pulse from PIC then get and count pulses given time interval and display it on PC
Anyone can help me?
