					<description><![CDATA[Hi all, 
I am trying to finish my project and looking for some one that can assemble a control board for me per the below requirements. I am sorry,I am a pure mechanical engineer and dont have much idea on these control boards, but know my requirements very well, so any help or lead will be appreciated. 
My requirements are as following. : 
for this project: I took 12V DC motors from a toy CAR that is capable of stearing at least two kids (about 165lb)....
To control DC motor whose specs are,
6V/12V supply voltage,
15 to 30A power
Need a micro chip controller that can,
1, Reduce the speed of the motor from to 2rpm,
2, Handling functions like CW AND CCW (clockwise and counter cwise)
3, time based forward and revers motion: Soft start - CW for 2seconds - soft stop- pause1sec - soft start CCW for 2seconds – soft stop – number of cycles
4, Alternatively proximity/touch sensor based CW and CCW (the board should be capable of giving the choice to select either sensor driven or time driven
5, ON/OFF using remote.
6, Number of cycles be relayed to any mobile phone.

Please notice that we need at least one assembly board that can be readily used]]></description>
