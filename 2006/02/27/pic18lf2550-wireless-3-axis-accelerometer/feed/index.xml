					<description><![CDATA[Hi Steve, I want to implement a vibration monitoring system using a PIC18F microcontroller. I&#039;m almost new to this and I was hoping how could you help me. I only have acces to 2 accelerometers here in my country, the Analog Devices ADXL321 and the MEMSIC2125 from PARALLAX. Which would be better suited for vibration monitoring in rotating machines with speed up to 5000 rpm. Thanks in advance

					<description><![CDATA[hi i am working on 3 axis acceleromater data to transmit.
which one microcontroller is best to us for this purpose 

avr or pic....?
nd how i can get free sample acceleromater from freescle while company charge 12$ shipmint charges 
pleas guide me
contact my on my email(qamar_raza786@yahoo.com)
thank u in advance]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hi,
i&#039;ve a totally newbie question:
can you send and receive 3 simoultaneous and independent  streams of data of the 3 accelerometers, with just one transmitter ? or the stream transmitted is just one (and the the transmission is something like : (read and stream accelerometer x, for 1 ms; read and stream accelerometer y, for 1 ms; read and stream accelerometer z, for 1 ms; start again) ?

(i confess i didn&#039;tread the code)

Have a nice day!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I am working on a project involving detecting the overall fluctuation in conditions of a shipping container on the high seas.
The data has to be viewed real-time or minutely averaged.
What kind of software would maximise my data being received.
Would a software to Hardware interface be inferior to a software to software to hardware interface. Would satelite feed be better than GSM.

Thanks.]]></description>
