Yep, still working. Here are the current stats (currently 103 charge/discharge cycles): /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2017-06-02-Macbook-Pro-Battery-Stats.png

Note that the full charge capacity has decreased 800mAh from when I initially installed the battery.

My only complaint is that I believe the adhesive included with the replacement batteries has loosened because I now have a little rattle when I shake the computer. I need to open up the machine and make sure that the batteries (and connections) are secure.]]></description>
