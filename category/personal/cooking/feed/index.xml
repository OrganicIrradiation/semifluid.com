<p>Here&#8217;s the recipe (adapted from the <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/paula-deen/cinnamon-rolls-recipe.html">Paula Deen&#8217;s Cinnamon Rolls</a> recipe):</p>
<p><strong>Dough:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1/4-ounce package yeast (I used active yeast, hefe in Germany)</li>
<li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
<li>1/2 cup scalded milk</li>
<li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
<li>1/3 cup butter or shortening (I used butter)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>3 1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Filling:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1/2 cup melted butter, plus more for pan</li>
<li>3/4 cup sugar, plus more for pan</li>
<li>2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
<li>3/4 cup raisins, walnuts, or pecans, optional</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Glaze:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
<li>2 cups powdered sugar</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>3 to 6 tablespoons hot water</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Heat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
<li>In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water and set aside, allow to bloom.</li>
<li>In a large bowl mix milk, sugar, melted butter, salt and egg. Add 2 cups of flour and mix until smooth. Add yeast mixture. Mix in remaining flour until dough is easy to handle. Knead dough on lightly floured surface for 5 to 10 minutes. Place in well-greased bowl, cover and let rise until doubled in size, usually 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
<li>When doubled in size, punch down dough. Roll out on a floured surface into a 15 by 9-inch rectangle. Spread melted butter all over dough. Mix sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle over buttered dough. Sprinkle with walnuts, pecans, or raisins if desired. Beginning at the 15-inch side, role up dough and pinch edge together to seal. Cut into 12 to 15 slices.</li>
<li>Coat the bottom of baking pan with butter and sprinkle with sugar. Place cinnamon roll slices close together in the pan and let rise until dough is doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake for about 30 minutes or until nicely browned.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, mix butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla. Add hot water 1 tablespoon at a time until the glaze reaches desired consistency. Spread over slightly cooled rolls.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J3V90Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004J3V90Y&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=semifluidcom-20">Canon T3i</a> with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009XVCZ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00009XVCZ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=semifluidcom-20">Canon EF 50mm f1.4</a> lens that I use for the gross majority of my day-to-day photography these days. I&#8217;ve been using a custom firmware for the Canon called <a href="http://www.magiclantern.fm/">Magic Lantern</a> that provides a some interesting (and useful!) <a href="http://www.magiclantern.fm/features.html">functions</a>.  One of them is HDR video.  Here&#8217;s a beautiful example of what can be done:</p>
<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLxYTT_0GEI</p>
<p>I tried my hand at processing the HDR video output and was able to get a reasonably nice tone-mapped video:</p>
<p><iframe title="Magic Lantern HDR video - Apple being washed - Reinhard02" width="648" height="365" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OfC8oNQ4MV8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>After the break, you&#8217;ll find how I processed the initial Magic Lantern video using MATLAB and exiftool and tone-mapped the output using Luminance HDR.</p>
<p><span id="more-3713"></span></p>
<p>First, we need to process the video with a function I (poorly) named &#8216;Step1MovieToInterpolatedFrames.m&#8217; to separate the dark and light frames.  The video is first loaded using the VideoReader object.  Then we check to see if the first frame is darker or lighter than the second. This is admittedly a bit of a hack, but given the gross differences in exposure, seems to work well enough.  After determining whether the first is light or dark, we then loop through all the frames of the movie, saving the real frames and appending an &#8220;L&#8221; to signify they are &#8220;light&#8221; and, also, interpolate between the frames.  Why go through the bother of interpolation? Well, there will be image registration problems with the tone-mapping if we assume that a given dark frame matches the earlier or later light frame, especially with high-speed motion. Interpolation helps us &#8220;smooth&#8221; these errors out. Note that ideally we would use a morphing algorithm (similar to the one used by Twixtor), but this is the quickest method for the time being. After saving each frame, I use <a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/">exiftool</a> to assign an aperture value.  Note that this has <em>nothing</em> to do with the real aperture value, but helps Luminance HDR tonemap the composite image. We do this for the dark frames as well, but now we take into account the EV shift in the video&#8217;s ISO when writing the aperture value using exiftool.</p>
<p>The second function, &#8216;Step2FramesToHDRFrames.m&#8217;, takes the individual light and dark frames and generates tone-mapped images.  We go through every frame and use the Luminance HDR CLI (command line interface) to generate an HDR image and tone-map it (here using the mantiuk08 tone-mapping operator).</p>
<p>And the final function (&#8216;Step3HDRFramesToVideos.m&#8217;) compiles all of the tone-mapped images into videos (one for the light frames, one for the dark frames, and one for the tonemapped frames).</p>
<p>The code can be found at the bottom of the post.</p>
<p>So, what do each of the Luminance HDR <a href="http://osp.wikidot.com/parameters-for-photographers">tonemapping operators</a> look like (with their default parameters) when applied to a video?  Here&#8217;s the source (note that YouTube strips out the alternating frames, you can find the original MOV <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MVI_7961.MOV">here</a>):</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another baking-related post, because I had the time on the weekend to do some more cooking while my wife was out of town.</p>
<p>In my last post, <a href="/2013/07/29/puff-pastries-with-blueberry-compote/">blueberries were on sale</a>.  This time, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redcurrant" target="_blank">Johannisbeeren</a> were on sale, so I wanted to take advantage of the fresh fruit.  Johannisbeeren are unfamiliar to me, being an Eastern US native, but I find them incredibly delicious.  They are tart like a cranberry, but have a great &#8220;berry flavor&#8221; when sweetened that I find hard to resist.  There are lots of Johannisbeeren pastries and tarts available here in Hesse, Germany, but this was my first opportunity to work with the fresh fruit. And without further ado, here&#8217;s a video demonstrating how I made puff pastries with fresh Johannisbeeren, with CC-licensed music by <a href="http://goo.gl/4u9bPr" target="_blank">Jill Zimmerman</a>.</p>
<p><center><br />

</center><br />
<span id="more-3573"></span><br />
Here is the recipe for the Johannisbeeren compote that I made in the video (I would recommend increasing the sugar content because the compote turned out more tart than I preferred):</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>500g fresh Johannisbeeren (red currants)</li>
<li>3 tablespoons water</li>
<li>1/2 cup (125g) sugar</li>
<li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Directions</strong><br />
Combine approx 1 cup the Johannisbeeren, water, sugar and lemon juice in a small saucepan. Cook over a medium heat for about 10 minutes. Add the rest of the Johannisbeeren and cook for 10 minutes more, stirring frequently.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok, so this post is not shape or electronics related, but still a fun little side project.  Since I started working at Justus-Liebig-Universität in Gießen, Germany as a postdoc, my wife and I have cooked as much homemade food as possible.  Germany is full of fantastic, inexpensive, and fresh ingredients, so we want to take advantage of whatever is available seasonally.</p>
<p>This week, blueberries were on sale, 0,49€ for 200g, and puff pastry dough is really inexpensive as well, 0,69€ for a sheet.  So, here&#8217;s my first attempt at a &#8220;foodie&#8221; video demonstrating how I made puff pastries with fresh <a href="http://goo.gl/hdFc3l" target="_blank">blueberry compote</a>, with CC-licensed music by <a href="http://goo.gl/tiz6nY" target="_blank">Jill Zimmerman</a>.</p>

</center><br />
<span id="more-3508"></span><br />
The only thing &#8220;major thing&#8221; missing from the demo was how the dough was cut and formed into its pre-filled shape.  The really simple method is illustrated in this video (method is shown starting at approx. 7m25s, until approx. 7m45s):</p>
