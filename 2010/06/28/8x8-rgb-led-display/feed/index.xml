					<description><![CDATA[download processing 1.2.1 and your file....  and try it with my hardware.... 
and also not working well...flashing.... and on the movie they are al red (for example) and then 1 pcb stays the color before....

maybe my wires are to long?

tomorro i first make them alright...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmm  how do you did it?... I have build 8 PCB.... with 4 everting went well, but with 8 not... and you have 16?
and i have try dr1r7 ( this one works  alright , if i don&#039;t send data to fast...

but dr1r8 (with the &#038;Haa) shows something but with al lot of wrong colors and not  good...

so I hope you give the source and  visual basic program for this...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Peter: The reason that it appears as though it is constantly resetting is because the code now looks for a &quot;sync byte&quot; at the beginning of each command: 0xAA

To get the VB code working with the DR1r8 firmware, a modification needs to be made to the Form1.vb source code in Private Sub timerPlayMovie_Tick.  Change the following snippets of code:
tempData = Chr(&amp;H10)
tempData = tempData &amp; Chr(Int(movieColor(currentFrame,...

To:
tempData = Chr(&amp;HAA)
tempData = tempData &amp; Chr(&amp;H10)
tempData = tempData &amp; Chr(Int(movieColor(currentFrame,...

Basically, this just appends the sync byte to the beginning of the packet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ok, i managed to get the dr1r7 code running with the vb app using the precompiled .hex but i cant get the dr1r8 code working, seems like its constantly reseting or something. next is to try and move the code over to hitech C so i can recompile with my hardware changes in the code]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Looks to me that the CCS compiler isnt a free C compiler. well at least the version that I have that seems to come with MPLAB is asking for a file. Any chance of a Hitech C lite version of the code?

I will have a look at converting it but i havnt played with it before so i dont know how i will go.]]></description>
