					<description><![CDATA[16F628 Serial 4 LED PWM – 4-bit exp DR1r8.c

HELLO I DO LIKE TO PLAY WITH PICS .. I DO LIKE THIS PROJECT 

I NEED TO HELP ME ABOUT HOW TO COMPILE THE ABOVE C FILE ??I TRIED WITH MPLAM AND GIVE ME ERRORS .. please show me the way

					<description><![CDATA[@Peter: I&#039;ve actually run into a speed barrier with the current generation of boards.  The problem is that 4MHz internal oscillator will only allow a maximum of 19200 baud (due to the SPBRG settings).  I can only achieve a maximum of ~12 FPS on the display due to the slow RS-232 speed.  This is because I am transmitting 144 bytes to update the entire display, so the maximum theoretical throughput at 19200 baud would be 16 fps.  If I could run these at 115200, I could have  a theoretical max of 100 fps.  If you plan on using these in a very timing-dependent manner, then you might want to consider increasing the clock speed to 20MHz (using a crystal or resonator) and increasing the RS-232 baud rate to 115200.  The newer 18F series would be even better, but frankly, the cost could be prohibitive for a larger-scale display.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Peter: You are absolutely correct.  It turns out that the EAGLE library I was using to generate the boards had drill sizes that were just too small.  I was able to solder the sockets onto the board, it just was a little bit awkward because they are not placed through-hole!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

Im wondering about the interface between the PC and the boards. what are ypou doing there, how are you powering the boards etc.

its one thing to have a few running on a project board. i think its a different story to get em running in a 4x4 grid thats standalone.]]></description>
