					<description><![CDATA[Luxdrive has some really nice drivers. Stable and accurate with dimming, strobe, boost, buck, ac/dc, and battery pwr options in small weather resistant epoxy packages. Dimming is done with high frequency PWM eliminating visible pulsing. They are available in 350ma, 750ma, 1000ma, and 1500ma models for under $20. They have a link to their distributers. I have bought some and Im thoroughly satisfied with them.]]></description>
