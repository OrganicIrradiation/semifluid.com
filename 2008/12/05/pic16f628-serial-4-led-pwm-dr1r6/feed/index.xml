					<description><![CDATA[Hello,
I am just wondering how to do it. I am running a bar and i would like to have such a thing in it. Would you be so kind and send me some schemes or hints? I really appreciate your work. I am not an expert in technics. What is that program you run your LEDs with? 
I am looking forward to your reply.
Thanks]]></description>
