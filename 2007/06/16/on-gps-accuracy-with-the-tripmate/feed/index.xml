					<description><![CDATA[Most GPS devices use amplified antennas.  I bought a module from Trimble that included an antenna with an LNA (low noise amplifier) and a five or ten foot cable.   Sparkfun Electronics (www.sparkfun.com) has GPS antennas that have integrated LNA&#039;s in them, and the whole shebang hanging off of a cable.  You&#039;ve gotta have an LNA for GPS, as the satellites are broadcasting at quite low signal level.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, great project..!!, maybe you should get a new GPS receiver, I&#039;ve worked with the Garmin GPS 18 PC oem and it&#039;s accuracy is really nice for the google earth, the route is always good, over the streets, and  it doesn&#039;t neccesary needs sky view, it can get fixed position in my bedroom .]]></description>
