					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I hope you can help in my search for a program that will allow me to determine how many connection of friends stand between two random people who have never met.

My idea is to demonstrate to businesses how powerful the social graph is in the world of marketing.  A business would use their email address or facebook username together with their facebook friends as the first point of reference.  We will then take the email address or facebook username of a customer and calculate how many friends lists would have been required to reach that customer using social media.

I am aware that the API allows you to do all sorts of things and wonder if this level of functionality is possible.

Please advise.

Thanks
Chris]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

Is there some problem actually with connection cloud ?

Loading Facebook Data (scroll down to see progress)...

Fatal error: Cannot use string offset as an array in /home/theacho2/public_html/facebook/connection/saveData.php on line 27

It&#039;s a great application ! 

Thanks]]></description>
