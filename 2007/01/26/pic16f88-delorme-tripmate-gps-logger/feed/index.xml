					<description><![CDATA[friend, built the circuit as it is, load the pic. Button to start works, also performs the reading, but can not get the circuit to work when the GPS already has an A in the plot GPRMC, simply EEPROM LED does not light, but if it does for downloading recorded data but as no do not get anything valid, I can do?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@mark

It will sort of... 

The hyperformance uses &quot;EARTHA&quot; as the string instead of &quot;ASTRAL&quot;.
Also and this is where it gets complicated, the hyperformance uses binary data instead of a $GPRMC sentence.  

So what does all this mean to you?  Well the code has to be rewritten to handle the binary data but the circuit is exactly the same.

I know it was nearly a year ago you asked this question.  But I thought I would provide the answer in case anyone stumbled along here.  If anyone has questions about the hyperformance, you can e-mail me at hyperformance(AT)learn2think.org. Of course replace (AT) with the appropriate symbol and hopefully that won&#039;t garner to much spam.]]></description>
