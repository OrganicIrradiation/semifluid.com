					<description><![CDATA[I have been looking for a GPS logger project for a while and your Tripmate is ideal. I would like to put it together with a  bit of future proofing such as capacity for Peter&#039;s add on of your LCD panel. As serendipity (aka Sod&#039;s Law) would have it, Peter&#039;s cvtelectronics.com site has recently been taken down. Google&#039;s cache of the site whet my appetite but cannot give the schematic!

Would you have a copy of Peter&#039;s schematic using the 18F2550? Or is it obvious enough to build the Tripmate using the 18F2550, just matching equivalent 16F88 pin connections?

I am fairly handy with a soldering iron, but this is my first PIC project. Any help or comments would be appreciated.

					<description><![CDATA[I have posted, with Steven&#039;s permission, a version of his GPS with time and speed for the PIC18F2550 which also uses his graphical LCD drivers for the 128x64 pixel LCD.  You can find it on this website: http://www.cvtelectronics.com/GPS.html

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, when compiling with ccs 4.023 you have to change the ORG:
#ORG 0x0F90,0x0FFF {}  
otherwise you will get errors (does not fit into rom).

					<description><![CDATA[I thought the original porject was cool, and when I see this recent update, I am just ecstatic.  Well done project and writeup!  
Since I&#039;ve blown up so many &quot;PIC programmers&quot; so far (fragile things when they meet Ms. Wired), I&#039;m moving to &quot;bootloadable&quot; versions as fast as I can whenever I can.
C.Lathe -- Mouser &#038; Digikey both carry PICs (since Mouser is in TX I get overnight delivery to OK for UPS Ground cost), as well as many hobby outfits.]]></description>
