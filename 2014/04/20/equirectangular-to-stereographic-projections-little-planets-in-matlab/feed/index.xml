					<description><![CDATA[Hello! I specialize in creating stereographic panorama&#039;s or (&quot;Little Planets&quot;) like the last image posted on this page and I am now wondering if it is possible to generate the stereographic projections (“Little Planets”) to an equirectangular panorama for building virtual tours. &quot;Part of the complication is that I have photoshopped the panorama&#039;s and they are now 1 flat image, not multiple pictures/layers.&quot; This conversion seems to be the exact opposite of what everyone else is trying to do so I haven&#039;t had much luck with figuring this out. Please help! Thanks!!]]></description>
