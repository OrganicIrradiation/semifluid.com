					<description><![CDATA[Thanks a lot !

I&#039;ve digged through Blender&#039;s 2.6&#039;s docs already, but I was looking for examples on boolean operations &#038; fixing normals ...
... so yup, you actually &quot;made my day&quot; ;p

Also, I will continue to read through the docs, but if you had hints/advices on the following, I&#039;d be glad to know about it ;) :

*Best way to add thickness to a mesh ? ( extrude it or ... )
*Make sure a mesh is correctly &quot;oriented&quot; ( ex: mask facing &quot;north&quot; )
*Add little holes ( cylinder boolean op ? ) to sides ( left &#038; right ) of a mesh ? ( ex:mask )

-&#062; I&#039;ll do my duty, but if you could throw me an aknowledged-bone, I&#039;d love that ;)

Well, I&#039;ll continue to read your posts,
And I&#039;m truly looking forward to reading from you

Keep up the good work !
