					<description><![CDATA[Hello, how are you!
I know this post is from the year 2013, but would like to enteder as is done the part that makes the trigger oscilloscope, had as you explain to me, for I am with a small oscilloscope project but do not want to copy and mount, I I want to like the fact enteder program works.
I await a response.

I&#039;ve transitioned my blog to another host and there may be some broken elements, but I just double checked and it appears as though the github gists are correctly displayed in Safari and Chrome on a Mac?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I assembled this oscilloscope, there are several problems. Prompt with their decision.

1) When the test device, the graphics are cut in half (bottom). I had the idea that the scheme is not enough for the amplifier bias voltage. Someone did it? Can you give the scheme?

2) When summing up his hands to the analog input of Arduino, is responsible for receiving the signal, the oscilloscope shows the sine wave cheerfully 50-52Hz (full, without clipping). Indications on the screen is updated several times per second. If you hear any waveform, the oscilloscope begins to slow down (readings and schedule may hang for a few seconds, up to 7-10 seconds). After changing picture hangs again. If the disable generator and bring again hand, in 50% of cases, skokrost display returns. Can you suggest a solution to this problem?

Thank you]]></description>
