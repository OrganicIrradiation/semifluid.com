Josh, the bottle appeared to be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_displacement_pump#Positive_displacement_pump&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Positive Displacement Pump&lt;/a&gt; style container, so I would assume there would not have been propellants.

Jack, thank you for the information, that&#039;s a very helpful explanation of the &quot;technical&quot; versus &quot;relative&quot; DEET concentrations.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[DEET is a chemical called N,N-Diethyl-m-toluamide.  The technical grade that is used in repellent products is purified to about 98% pure DEET and the remainder is related compounds. These closely related compounds are repellent but they are not actually the exact chemical DEET as labeled, so they are required to mark the product with the actual percentage of true DEET. They do put 100% technical DEET in the can and are trying to get a little bit of marketing mileage out of the 2% related materials.

The reason that the Relative % Deet was removed from the label is because the US EPA instructed Repel to stop using that claim in October 2008.  The EPA reviews and controls all language that is used on pesticide and repellent products.

FYI: I don&#039;t have any connection whatsoever to United Industries, I just happen to work with EPA regulatory matters.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Propellant? I would still say it&#039;s ok to call it 100% deet if that&#039;s the case. 

Otherwise you would have to call Chicken &quot;30% chicken&quot; because it&#039;s 70% water.]]></description>
