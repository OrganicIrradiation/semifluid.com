					<description><![CDATA[Hello about your work! I found the maximum.
I want to do one of these, could you please send me the project? Which compiler did you use? I&#039;m having a hard time compiling your code. I want to learn how to use your example of PWM.
Thank you very much.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[RA5 is not the same as MCLR on those parts.  RA5 is a regular I/O pin, except that the output driver is open-drain.  I was bitten by the same RA5 problem with the 16F627A a few years back.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am working with a friend to write a driver interface for our Christmas Lighting program called Vixen to run these.  However, I do not see a whole lot on how to set them up.  Especially getting the address set and how to send the different commands.

Can I get some more details on that please?]]></description>
