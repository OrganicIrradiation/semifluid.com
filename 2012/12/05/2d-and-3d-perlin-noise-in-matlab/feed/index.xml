					<description><![CDATA[Dear mr. Steave,

My name is Antonio,
I&#039;m from Genoa North Italy,
Congratulations I follow many of his works.

Escuse me but I&#039;m trying this place because the other (contact me) does not accept my email.

Your project of glcd scope is very nice.
I made the oscilloscope and
I used a PIC18f4550 instead of a PI18F2550
I try to load this file .hex
http://semifluid.com/wp-content/uplo...bootloader.hex
generated by this CCS code
http://semifluid.com/wp-content/uplo...o-bootloader.c of your web site.

I don&#039;t understand......
Show only the positive part of a sine wave and it is positioned at the bottom.
The frequency and the line of zero-crossing dont&#039;works.

Can you send me a other .hex 

Tanks

bye
Antonio]]></description>
