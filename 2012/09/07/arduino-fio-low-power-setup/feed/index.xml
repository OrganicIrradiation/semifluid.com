					<description><![CDATA[I guess the pull-up version is the better variant, as you wont have the 330 uA during sleep. Also, you would not need to physically solder a resistor, as you could utilise the built-in pull-up (with the command pinMode(xx, INPUT_PULLUP).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/09/07/arduino-fio-low-power-setup/#comment-15158&quot;&gt;James&lt;/a&gt;.

When using a barebones Fio with only an XBee, the majority of that number is XBee power. In fact, Im on a similar project and found that just plugging the XBee in gave indeed around 60 mA, and putting it to sleep around 56-57. As the FIO alone consumes 3.75 mA idle and 112 uA in power_down_sleep in my project, its all XBee. 

So I would say that you do not succeed in putting the XBee to sleep...

On a different note, would it make any difference if I attached pull-up to the XBee instead of pull-down for sleeping? Because as I see it, the pull-down version, with a 10k resistor, will draw about 330 uA during sleep, which is triple what I consume without it..

A pull-up would seem to not use nearly as much during sleep, instead using 330 uA extra when sending information, which is neglible on top of the standard XBee power consumption...??]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, thanks for doing these writeups. I&#039;m following your guide using a Fio and an XBee and I&#039;m not see very much reduction in power usage. I&#039;ve got nothing plugged in to the Fio and when it first comes on its drawing 60mA. When it enters the sleep cycle it only goes down to 54mA. Do you have any tips for troubleshooting?]]></description>
